# Available Modules

We have quite a few modules pre-written for our projects. These modules accomplish basic tasks like maintaining app state, building routes, providing form components connected to redux store, etc.

You can choose to install these modules when creating your app or you can add them later. All of these modules are plug-n-play.
And although you do not need to setup any of these modules yourself, generally, its a good idea to go through the documentation to familiarise yourself with the way components in our system work.
