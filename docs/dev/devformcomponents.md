# Rudux Form Components

All Redux Form components live in the `ReduxFormComponents` module.


Within the `ReduxFormComponents` module, there is a Storybook for you to play with form components outside of your app.

If you want to get stuck into development.

1. Git clone the https://github.com/BlueChilli/ChilliSource.Front.Modules repo
2. CD into `ReduxFormComponents`.
3. yarn install
4. yarn run storybook
