# Form Components

We have pre-written basic form components, derived from [`redux-form`](https://redux-form.com/) and already attached to the app's redux store. You can directly start using these components like you would any HTML component out of the box.

We provide the following components(_more to come_);

- [`TextField`](/FormComponents/components/TextField/index.md)
- [`TextArea`](/FormComponents/components/TextArea/index.md)
- [`Radio`](/FormComponents/components/Radio/index.md)
- [`Radios`](/FormComponents/components/Radios/index.md)
- [`Checkbox`](/FormComponents/components/Checkbox/index.md)
- [`Checkboxes`](/FormComponents/components/Checkboxes/index.md)
- [`Select`](/FormComponents/components/Select/index.md)
- [`MultiSelect`](/FormComponents/components/MultiSelect/index.md)
- [`CalendarPicker`](/FormComponents/components/CalendarPicker/index.md)
