# Form Components

We have pre-written basic form components, derived from [`redux-form`](https://redux-form.com/7.4.2/) and already attached to the app's redux store. You can directly start using these components like you would any HTML component out of the box.

We provide the following components(_more to come_);

- [`TextField`](components/TextField/index.md)
- [`TextArea`](components/TextArea/index.md)
- [`Radio`](components/Radio/index.md)
- [`Radios`](components/Radios/index.md)
- [`Checkbox`](components/Checkbox/index.md)
- [`Checkboxes`](components/Checkboxes/index.md)
- [`Select`](components/Select/index.md)
- [`MultiSelect`](components/MultiSelect/index.md)
- [`CalendarPicker`](components/CalendarPicker/index.md)
